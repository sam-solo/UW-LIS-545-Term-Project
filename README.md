This document describes the files in this repository. The dataset, titled Yahoo! Answers Topic Classification, originally consitsted or two data sets: a dataset for intended for training AI and a dataset intended to test the AI. The training dataset was a large file, and had to be split into multiple different .CSV files to meet GitHub's submission standards. The testing dataset was also too large for GitHub's submission restrictions, and was converted to a zip file. 

The file test.csv.zip is the dataset containing test data. Files train.csv1 - train.56.csv are the culimatation of the train dataset, organized in split files marked numerically. The file manifest.txt describes the process of splitting the files and how the files are labeled.
