LIS 545 Term Project 

This document describes the files in this repository. The dataset, titled Yahoo! Answers Topic Classification, originally consisted of two data sets: a dataset intended for training an algorithm or AI in text classification and machine learning, and another dataset for testing the algorithm. This structure is typical for those disciplines. The training dataset was a large file, and had to be split into multiple different .CSV files to meet GitHub's submission standards. The testing.csv dataset was also too large for GitHub's submission restrictions, and was converted to a zip file. These files are accessible in the Data folder located on the main page of the repository. 

The file test.csv.zip is the dataset containing test data. Files train-01.csv - train-56.csv are the culimatation of the train.csv dataset, organized in split files marked sequentially. The file manifest.txt describes the files that are were generated from the split program.

The file Term Project Paper contains a Data and Metadata Profile of the dataset, and it contains a Respository Profile on the Social Computing Data Repository, which would be an appropriate fit for the dataset.
